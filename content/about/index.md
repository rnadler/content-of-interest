This is **Bob's content of interest** posting site. 

The links in each post are curated by me. The [elfeed-curate](https://github.com/rnadler/elfeed-curate) Emacs package is used to automatically generate the Markdown content for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) publication. 

One of the biggest challenges of managing RSS feeds is filtering out the noise. Specifically, "noise" is defined as *things I'm not interested in*. Most of my [Elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) feeds have noisy content. Besides my opinionated topic selection (below), sometimes there's marketing crap, political/personal pieces, or just a subject that is not presented well. 

Topics of interest:

* Medical Device Software Development
* FDA Regulations and EU MDR 
* Biomedical Engineering
* EEG/BMI Technologies
* Software Engineering and Architecture
* Functional Programming -- Clojure(Script) Development
* Emacs

Each post has two important attributes:

1. The **noise** has been removed (as best I can).
2. Annotation is sometimes added to links to make it easier to decide if you want to explore further. 

The result is something I hope you'll find useful. Feedback is always welcome!
